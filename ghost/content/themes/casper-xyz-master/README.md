### Hardcoded stuff

I try to make the theme reusable as possible, but I still have to hardcode some stuff.

* [GitHub, Mastodon and Shaarli links](https://github.com/Angristan/Casper-XYZ/blob/master/partials/site-nav.hbs#L16)
* [Vultr affiliate link](https://github.com/angristan/Casper-XYZ/blob/master/default.hbs#L32)

### External assets embedded

Here are the assets that I downloaded and included in the repo as I don't want to make call to 3rd-party services:

* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [Source Sans Pro font from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)

They are all under their respective licence.
